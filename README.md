# PH_Analysis

## Overview
   ### Purpose
   - The purpose of this project was to further analyze the employee database at PH based on previous successful analysis. Informing decision makers with actionable, relevant information will contribute positively to mitigating a potential "silver tsunami" in the coming months and years.

## Results
   ### Four Key Points
   1. Creating the Retirements Titles table and further distilling the data verified that there are over 72,000 PH employees eligible for retirement.
   2. A majority of the personnel hold "Senior" positions in Engineering and on the Staff.
   3. There are 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship towards positions of increasing responsibility in the company (based on the given parameters).
   4. Not all of the above-mentioned mentorship-eligible employees will be leadership candidates. Further analysis is required!

## Summary
   ### Questions Answered
   - The first task of this project answered the query: *What employees were born between 1952 and 1955 and what are their titles?* In identifying the number of employees eligbile for retirement, then further refining that dataset to verify only those personnel still with the company, the PH board of directors and the C-Suite leaders are now poised to make better HR decisions.
   - The second task answered the query: *What current employees are eligble for a Mentorship Program?* Focusing on a specific cohort of employees born in 1965 is certainly 'a way' to identify those potentially eligible for positions of increased responsibility, but the question remains: What other parameters might PH use to idenitfy, track, and see personnel succeed in a Mentorship Program?
