# PH_Analysis

## Overview
   ### Purpose
   - The purpose of this project was to further analyze the employee database at PH based on previous successful analysis. Informing decision makers with actionable, relevant information will contribute positively to mitigating a potential "silver tsunami" in the coming months and years.

## Results
   ### Four Key Points
   1. Creating the Retirements Titles table and further distilling the data verified that there are over 72,000 PH employees eligible for retirement.
   2. A majority of the personnel hold "Senior" positions in Engineering and on the Staff.
   3. There are 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship roles in the company (based on the given parameters).
   4. Not all of the above-mentioned mentorship-eligible employees will be leadership candidates. Further analysis is required!

## Summary
   ### Questions Answered
   - The first task of this project answered the query: **How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?** In identifying the number of employees eligbile for retirement, then further refining that dataset to verify only those personnel still with the company, the PH board of directors and the C-Suite leaders are now poised to make better HR decisions. For further analysis we propose, *What departments might PH need to increase revenue across to mitigate the loss of personnel, and thus, earning potential, in the next 5-10 years?* Assessing impact must involve more than diving into surface employee data, but this is absolutely a necessary start!
   - The second task answered the query: **Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the daprtments to mentor the next generation of PH employees?** Focusing on a specific cohort of employees born in 1965 is certainly 'a way' to identify those potentially eligible for positions of increased responsibility, but the question remains: *What other parameters might PH use to idenitfy, track, and see personnel succeed in a Mentorship Program?* Perhaps assessing length of time in role, aptitude in job performance, and desire for positions of increased responsibility (and compensation) might provide a more qualitative view for the PH Board and C-Suite.
