# PH_Analysis

## Overview
   ### Purpose
   - The purpose of this project was to further analyze the employee database at PH based on previous successful analysis. Informing decision makers with actionable, relevant information will contribute positively to mitigating a potential "silver tsunami" in the coming months and years.

## Results
   ### Four Key Points
   - Creating the Retirements Titles table and further distilling the data verified that there are over 72,000 PH employees eligible for retirement.
   - A majority of the personnel hold "Senior" positions in Engineering and on the Staff.
   - There are 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship towards positions of increasing responsibility in the company (based on the given parameters).
   - Not all of the above-mentioned mentorship-eligible employees will be leadership candidates. Further analysis is required!
